# Bridge and Seek

A privacy-first cross-chain bridge application powered by Substance Labs' bridge that enables seamless token transfers between Base Sepolia and Aztec Sepolia, with built-in private swapping capabilities.

## 🌉 Overview

Bridge and Seek demonstrates the power of privacy-preserving cross-chain interactions by allowing users to:
- Bridge tokens from Base Sepolia into Aztec's private ecosystem
- Bridge tokens out from Aztec to Base Sepolia
- Perform private token operations within Aztec
- Execute cross-chain swaps while maintaining transaction privacy

The application showcases Aztec's privacy features through both public and private token operations, providing a complete demonstration of confidential cross-chain DeFi.

## ✨ Key Features

### Core Bridge Functionality
- **Shield (Bridge In)**: Transfer WETH from Base Sepolia to Aztec Sepolia
- **Unshield (Bridge Out)**: Transfer WETH from Aztec back to Base Sepolia  
- **7683 Standard**: Intent-based cross-chain order system for secure transfers

### User Experience
- **Embedded Wallet**: No popups or external wallet apps required. Everything is generated in-browser
- **MetaMask Integration**: Seamless connection for EVM operations
- **Account Abstraction**: Sponsored fee payments through SponsoredFPC

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🛠️ Development

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Contract Development
yarn build-contracts      # Compile Noir contracts and generate TypeScript artifacts
yarn deploy-contracts     # Deploy all contracts to Aztec network

# Application Development  
yarn dev                  # Start development server
yarn build-app           # Production build with Webpack
yarn build               # Full build (contracts + app)
yarn serve               # Serve production build

# Testing & Quality
yarn test                # Run E2E test suite
yarn prep-test           # Deploy contracts and build for testing
yarn lint                # Check code formatting

# Performance Options
PROVER_ENABLED=false yarn deploy-contracts  # Skip proof generation for faster development
```

## 🔗 Technical Architecture

### Cross-Chain Bridge
- **Bridge Implementation**: Built on [Substance Labs Aztec-EVM Bridge](https://github.com/substance-labs/aztec-evm-bridge)
- **Source Chain**: Base Sepolia 
- **Destination Chain**: Aztec Testnet
- **Bridge Token**: WETH
  - Base Sepolia: `0x1BDD24840e119DC2602dCC587Dd182812427A5Cc`
  - Aztec Sepolia: `0x089d76aaa3261376f2073894cddff9a070c1ca2c3ae2a2b25fcce25d68caae81`
- **Gateway Contract**: `0x85752d27D29FF5D0683b8aE1B60705080CA7142f`
- **Architecture**: Intent-based settlement with zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving cross-chain transfers

### Aztec Integration
- **PXE**: Client-side Private eXecution Environment for proof generation
- **Account Contracts**: ECDSA keys for EVM wallet compatibility
- **Note System**: Encrypted UTXO-like notes for private state
- **Fee Abstraction**: Sponsored transactions through SponsoredFPC

### Security Features
- Zero-knowledge proofs for transaction privacy
- Client-side proof generation (no trusted setup)
- Optional auditability through selective disclosure
- Secure cross-chain message passing via 7683 standard

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive E2E tests using Playwright:

```bash
# Run full test suite
yarn test

# Run tests without proof generation (faster)
PROVER_ENABLED=false yarn test
```
